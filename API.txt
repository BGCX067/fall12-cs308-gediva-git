What Project Does
Visualizes chronological numerical 2D data for countries (example: http://bit.ly/QcbFEM)
Takes in data from a file (chosen through a JFileBrowser), packages the data in a DataSet, which can take on the types Bar, Line, Map, or Bubble and can be expanded to more types.

Input:
CSV data table (e.g. rows - countries; columns - years)
Data type (e.g., education spending, percent of GDP) => needed to label the plot
Visualization type (choose from available options)

Restrictions
Dataset has to be:
-- rows are countries
-- columns are years
-- fields are numbers

Visualization types
-- Line (1 country data for many years is displayed)
-- Bar (1 year data for many countries is displayed)
-- Comparison (2 countries are compared across a range of years)

What Model does
--contains DataSet object
-- reads and stores a file
-- validate data
-- contains functions loadFile(), loads a file, and getData(country, year) returns data for a given country and year

Summary of API between Model and View based on proposed example
-- View team needs to write:
View.java communicates with model, maintains list of countries
Visualization.java abstract class containing common elements from three visualizations
BarGraph.java, contains list of names, list of data, data type name, computes scaled height
LineGraph.java, contains list of data, list of years, country name, computes scaled height
ComparisonGraph.java, contains two countries, list of years, lists of data, computes scale
---------------------------------------
-- Model team needs to write:
DataSet.java, reads the data, stores it, provides on demand

API functions:
loadFile() contained in model, called by view in order to load a file
getData() contained in model, called by view in order to get a data point
getMinYear() contained in model, tells view what the minimum year is
getMaxYear() contained in model, tells view what the maximum year is
getCountries() contained in model, tells view what countries there are in an array

Examples:
User clicks button in window.
Button calls loadFile in the model, which opens a file browser for the user to select a file.
File is read and stored by DataSet.
User selects a visualization from drop-down menu in window.
View creates appropriate visualization object, using the min and max year, list of countries.
Visualization object uses getData in order to obtain data from model and create elements
View displays data from visualization object.

Alternatives:
Bar, LinePoint, Comparison are objects in the model, created by the model on demand and passed to the view
We chose our current plan due to the fact it only requires ints and Strings to be passed between the view and model.
